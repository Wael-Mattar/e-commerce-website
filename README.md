# first_website-grocery-store-project
Grocery store website project(Html, css, js, MongoDB, NodeJs). This is a grocery store website that I did as a project in my Web Programming course. I used a template for the homepage, but did some little changes to it. I also added some backend functions. Some of the functions are: login, signup, change password, and logout using ajax. Furthermore, I added an option for the admin to insert products with details and image to mongodb database, and another option for the admin to delete products from the database. Last, I added a cart for the user to insert or delete products from it.
